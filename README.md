# Predicting loan default in peer-to-peer loan markets
In this project I have used methods machine learning models and Natural Language Processing to build predictive models, and test to which degree I can predict whether borrowers will default on their loans in peer-to-peer lending markets. I have used  data from one of the world’s largest P2P platforms, Lending Club. The data is publicly available on www.lendingclub.com

This data contains a range of interesting variables about the borrowers receiving the loans as well as whether the borrowers have defaulted or not. It contains quantitative loan-level data, such as the loan amount, the interest rate of the loan, and the annual income of the borrower. Interestingly, it also contains text bits written by borrowers themselves. These loan descriptions serve as the borrower’s motivational let-ter for what he/she want to use the money for, and why he/she should be given it.
